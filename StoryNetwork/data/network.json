An overwhelming majority (98%) of Israeli Jews agree all Jews should have the right to  move to Israel and receive immediate citizenship. Close to half (48 percent)  support the expulsion or transfer of Arabs from Israel, yet most secular Jews  disagree (58%) with this, as do 54 percent of those in the center politically (more so from the left). Meanwhile, Israeli Arabs,  currently about one-in-five of the country's adults, generally do not think Israel can be a Jewish state and a democracy at the same time. Fewer  Arabs (down 24 points) think a peaceful, two-state solution is possible, from 74% in 2013 to 50% now. Both groups are skeptical of the peace process: Israeli Arabs question the sincerity of the Israeli government in seeking a peace agreement, while Israeli Jews are equally skeptical about the sincerity of Palestinian leaders",
