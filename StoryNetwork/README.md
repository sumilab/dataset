StoryNetworks is a dataset of networks constructed from short-form event descriptions collected from the [Wikipedia Current Events Portal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:Current_events).

# Source code
We plan to publicly release a Python script in the near future, enabling users to extract network data from this dataset.
